Occasionally in my travels I will pick up some antiquated device that has a PC interface. 

If mine came with a disk and a search of the internet returns a lot of people looking for said software, I'll create a disk image of the (typically floppy) disk and offer it here for download, along with the actual contents of the disk as a zip file.

* Craftsman Professional Autoranging Digital Multimeter - Model #82325 - PC Interface software (1.44MB floppy disk written for Windows 98)
